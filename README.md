Workflows to estimate pressure depletion for wells based on liquid volumes produced
# Objectives
* Determine a proxy for well depletion that incorporates timing and interaction of offset wells if any
##                      Applications
* Demonstrate pressure depletion is the controlling variable in well performance
* Demonstrate pressure depletion is the controlling variable causing GOR increases
* Demonstrate pressure depletion is the controlling variable in refrac uplift
